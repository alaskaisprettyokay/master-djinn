;; prompt pipeline
;; 1. generate prompt that will analyze actions
;;     inputs: intentions, stats

;; 2. generate prompt that will output changes in avatar
;;     inputs: analysis prompt, action data

;; 3. generate dalle prompt that makes variations to image based on changes
;;     inputs: changes, 

;; 4. DALLE generates variation of image


;; RETURNS
;; -  hash of avatar config + analysis prompt (saved in widget config so we dont have to regenerate analysis prompt everytime if config (mainly intentions) doesnt change
;; -  divination uuid
;; -  url of new image on DALLE
;; -  map of Â± attributes/body parts
